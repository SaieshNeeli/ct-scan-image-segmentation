# CT Scan Image Segmentation Using ENet

This repository provides a deep learning-based solution for **segmenting CT scan images** into lung and infection regions using **ENet**, an efficient deep learning segmentation model.

---

##  Features
- **Lung & Infection Segmentation** – Identifies infected and uninfected lung regions.
- **Lightweight & Fast Model** – Uses **ENet**, optimized for real-time applications.
- **Multi-Class Segmentation** – Classifies pixels into **background, lung, and infection**.
- **Python & TensorFlow** Implementation.

##  Dataset
The dataset consists of CT scan images with corresponding **lung masks** and **infection masks**.
